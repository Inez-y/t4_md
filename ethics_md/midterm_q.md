# **Midterm Preparation Answers Based on Lecture Notes**

---

## **Lecture 1: Moral Reasoning**

### **Expect trick questions**
- Some questions may ask for things that **cannot** be done. Example:
  - **"Provide an empirical justification for a moral claim."**
  - **Issue:** This violates the principle of "no ought from is"‚Äîmoral claims require at least one **value claim**, not just empirical facts.

- **Validity vs. Soundness**
  - **Valid argument:** If premises are true, conclusion must be true (truth-preserving).
  - **Sound argument:** Valid + all premises are true.

- **Empirical vs. Conceptual vs. Moral/Value Arguments**
  - **Empirical claims:** Can be tested using observation.
  - **Conceptual claims:** True by definition or logical necessity.
  - **Moral/value claims:** Involve "should" or "ought" and require justification beyond empirical facts.

## **Lecture 2: Conventional Morality**

### **Kohlberg‚Äôs Six Stages of Moral Development**
1. **Obedience & Punishment (Preconventional)** ‚Äì Morality = avoiding punishment.  
2. **Instrumental Exchange (Preconventional)** ‚Äì Morality = personal benefit.  
3. **Good Boy/Nice Girl (Conventional)** ‚Äì Morality = gaining approval from peers.  
4. **Law and Order (Conventional)** ‚Äì Morality = following rules to maintain social order.  
5. **Social Contract (Postconventional)** ‚Äì Laws exist for human rights but can be challenged.  
6. **Universal Moral Principles (Postconventional)** ‚Äì Justice transcends laws; morality > democracy.

### **Problems with Stage 4 (Law & Order)**
- **Unquestioning obedience to laws can lead to supporting injustice.**
  - Example: Nazi Germany‚Äîlaws were followed, but were morally wrong.
  - Example: Slavery was legal, but unjust.

### **Why Conventional Morality is Not the Final Level (Relation to Singer)**
- **Singer argues that convention does not define morality** (e.g., past norms justified racism/sexism).
- **Kohlberg‚Äôs conventional stages (3 & 4) rely on social norms, not universal ethical reasoning.**
- **True moral progress requires postconventional reasoning (Stages 5 & 6).**

### **Why Stage 6 Exists (Beyond Democracy)**
- **Stage 5 (Social Contract):** Accepts democracy and reforming unfair laws.  
- **Stage 6 (Universal Principles):** Sometimes, **democracy fails** (e.g., tyranny of the majority).  
- Example: Civil rights activists (MLK) used **civil disobedience** to challenge unjust laws.

## **Lecture 3: Relativism**

### **Descriptive vs. Normative Ethical Relativism**
- **Descriptive Ethical Relativism:** Different cultures have different moral codes.
- **Normative Ethical Relativism:** We **ought** to follow our own culture‚Äôs moral norms.

### **Objectivism vs. Absolutism**
- **Objectivism:** Moral truths exist independently of opinion, but can vary by context.
- **Absolutism:** Moral rules apply **without exception**, regardless of context.

### **Can Only Relativists Be Tolerant?**
- **No.** Objectivists can still respect cultural differences while rejecting harmful practices.
- **Example:** Opposing honor killings **is not intolerant**‚Äîit‚Äôs rejecting harm.

### **Problems with Normative Ethical Relativism**
1. **Self-contradiction**: Saying ‚Äúwe should tolerate all cultures‚Äù is itself a universal moral rule.
2. **Moral progress is impossible**: If morality is just based on culture, past injustices (slavery, sexism) could never be criticized.

## **Lectures 4 & 5: Utilitarianism**

### **Maximizing Happiness for the Majority?**
- **No.** Utilitarianism maximizes **total** happiness, not just **50%+1 of people**.

### **More Pleasure than Pain = Moral?**
- **No.** Actions must maximize **net** utility‚Äînot just be slightly more good than bad.

### **Knowing What to Do Without Knowing Consequences?**
- **Use past experience & probability.** Some actions (e.g., lying) **tend** to cause harm.

### **Does Utilitarianism Support Justice?**
- **Not necessarily.** Justice is valued **only if it maximizes utility**.
  - **Example:** Framing an innocent person to prevent riots may be justified under utilitarianism.

### **Criticisms of Normative Hedonism**
- **Pleasure is not the only good**: Truth, autonomy, and fairness matter too.
- **Nozick‚Äôs Experience Machine**: If pleasure was all that mattered, we'd all plug into a simulation.

### **Mill‚Äôs Quality of Pleasure vs. Bentham‚Äôs Quantity**
**Advantages:**
- Recognizes **higher pleasures** (intellectual, moral) vs. **lower pleasures** (basic pleasures).
- Avoids "Doctrine of Swine" (morality shouldn‚Äôt just maximize animalistic pleasures).

**Disadvantages:**
- Hard to define "higher" vs. "lower" pleasures.
- Relies on ‚Äúcompetent judges‚Äù (who decides?).

### **Objections & Mill‚Äôs Responses**
1. **"Too High for Humanity" Objection:**  
   - *Claim:* It‚Äôs unrealistic to expect people to always maximize utility.
   - *Mill‚Äôs Response:* We don‚Äôt need perfect motives‚Äîjust good rules to guide us.

2. **"Doctrine of Swine" Objection:**  
   - *Claim:* Utilitarianism treats us like animals, only seeking pleasure.
   - *Mill‚Äôs Response:* Higher pleasures (art, knowledge) are more valuable than mere pleasure.

3. **"Lack of Time" Objection:**  
   - *Claim:* No time to calculate utility before acting.
   - *Mill‚Äôs Response:* We use **general rules** from past experience.

### **Mill‚Äôs Justification (His ‚ÄúProof‚Äù)**
1. **People desire happiness ‚Üí Happiness is desirable.**
2. **Happiness is the only intrinsic good.**
3. **Society should maximize happiness for all.**

### **Problems with Aggregating Utility**
- **One person‚Äôs happiness can outweigh many others‚Äô suffering.**
  - *Example:* Slavery maximizes economic utility but is morally wrong.

### **Impartiality: Strength or Weakness?**
- **Problem:** Requires treating strangers the same as family.
- **Example:** Should you save **two strangers over your own child**?

### **Utilitarianism on Keeping Promises**
- **Promises are kept only if they maximize utility.**
  - *Example:* If breaking a promise helps more people, it‚Äôs justified.

### **Are Supererogatory Actions Possible?**
- **No.** According to utilitarianism (and Singer), we must **always** maximize utility.
  - *Example:* Donating money to charity isn‚Äôt "extra"‚Äîit‚Äôs morally required.

### **Problems with Punishment in Utilitarianism**
1. **Rehabilitation:** Good only if it maximizes utility.
2. **Deterrence:** May justify punishing an innocent person if it prevents crime.
3. **Vengeance:** Could justify public executions **if people enjoy them**.

### **Final Takeaways for the Midterm**
- **Know how to identify trick questions** (e.g., "derive an ought from an is").
- **Be precise about Kohlberg‚Äôs stages**‚Äîfocus on **why conventional morality isn‚Äôt enough**.
- **Understand why relativism is self-defeating**‚Äîit contradicts itself.
- **Utilitarianism isn‚Äôt just about happiness‚Äîit‚Äôs about maximizing utility.**
- **Challenge assumptions:** Why is pleasure the only good? Can morality exist without universal principles?
