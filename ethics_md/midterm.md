Midterm information
Your midterm grade (20%) includes:

the actual midterm exam (lec 1-5) with short answer questions (worth 19% of your final grade) and
an additional exam prep quiz, later in the course (after Lec 9), with 25 multiple choice questions (1% completion mark). 
Midterm exam (19% of final grade) to take in class
The midterm exam includes questions related to **lectures 1-5** (up to and including Utilitarianism I and II). The questions will either be taken from the **list of final exam questions in this Orientation folder**, or will be very similar to those questions.

Closed book, 2 hours, on paper

Final exam prep quiz (1% completion mark) to take at home after lec 9 (Virtue Ethics II) - Activities > Quizzes
Available three days - Thu, Fri, Sat all day (the course outline indicates the last day you can take it).

The multiple choice quiz covers lectures 1-9. It's only worth 1% but it's preparation for the final exam so it's important you take it seriously.

This quiz will include 25 multiple choice questions (modules 1-9, up to and including Virtue Ethics I and II). 

Time limit: 90 minutes + 5 minutes (grace period) - After the time limit and grace period expire, the quiz does not complete any action that users try to perform, but prompts them to submit their quiz attempt

Questions: 25

Attempts: unlimited (you get a full 10/10 for a reasonable attempt/s  (i.e. if you just submit an empty exam etc your mark will be zero))



Questions for midterm and final exam
Short answer questions will be chosen from this list (rare) or will be similar to these (typical). Since the questions that end up on the midterm and final exam may be worded differently, do make sure you read the questions in full on exam day.

The actual questions you get will in some cases be paired up with a case study containing a moral dilemma related to computing or may require that you provide your own example related to computing. They may require that you don't just explain something, but also argue for a particular point (e.g. was X right about Y, and why? - provide an example to support your claim)

If we haven't covered a particular topic this term (see all lectures in the course outline that includes a schedule), you won't get questions on that topic on the final exam.

Note that the final exam will also include an essay (similar to your essay II but a short case study is provided). There is a separate document with all the instructions for the final exam.

Again, keep in mind that the actual questions on the midterm and final exams will be slightly different but very similar to those below:

# Mieterm
Lec 1 Moral reasoning

Expect to see exercises similar to those we discussed in class. This may include "trick" questions where your knowledge is tested by asking you to do something that cannot be done. You'll need to be able to spot the issue and explain why you cannot provide an answer.

If you know this material well, you are likely to get 100% on these questions. You may also get 0% if it's clear you don't understand validity, soundness, what is a conceptual, moral/value or empirical argument. Most midterms and final exams include one question on moral reasoning.

 

Lec 2 Conventional Morality

Name Kohlberg’s six stages of moral development and briefly describe each.
Can it be problematic to remain in the law and order stage (Kohlberg) of moral development? Why?
What is the conventional level of moral development (Kohlberg), and why is it not the final level? (explicitly relate to Singer’s arguments in “All animals are equal”)
Why does Kohlberg describe a stage 6 of moral development? Should it not suffice to believe in democracy and in changing unfair laws using democratic processes, as someone in stage 5 will do? Briefly discuss.
 

Lec 3 Relativism

Distinguish descriptive ethical relativism from normative ethical relativism
Distinguish objectivism from absolutism (careful with using Google/ChatGPT for definitions as you may find entirely different definitions! Consider the definition of objectivism as discussed in class, and Pojman's definition of absolutism as discussed in class)
Is it true that only a relativist can be tolerant? Explain why this is not true and briefly discuss.
Suppose that a normative moral relativist argues that “out of respect and tolerance, we ought not to criticize other cultures.” Why is it problematic to argue this?
Identify two important arguments that can be raised against normative ethical relativism. Briefly discuss.
 

Lecs 4 and 5 Utilitarianism

Does utilitarianism ask us to maximize happiness for the majority (over 50%)? Explain.
Does utilitarianism ask us to do what causes more pleasure than pain? Explain.
How can utilitarians know what to do, if moral evaluation is based on the actual consequences of actions they haven’t done yet?
Utilitarianism says that we should consider interests equally. Does this mean that it advocates justice (e.g. borrowed money should be paid back, the terms of fair legal contracts should be followed, no one should be punished for a crime they didn't commit, etc..)? Explain.
Utilitarianism is a hedonistic moral theory. According to normative hedonism, the only intrinsic good is pleasure. What arguments can be raised against normative hedonism? Explain.
According to Mill, pleasure and pain can be evaluated according to quality, and not just according to quantity (as Bentham had argued). “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied, better Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied”, said Mill. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of Mill’s inclusion of quality in the measurement of utility?
What is the “Too high for humanity” objection to utilitarianism, and how has Mill responded to it?
What is the “Doctrine of swine” objection to utilitarianism, and how has Mill responded to it?
What is the “Lack of time” objection to utilitarianism, and how has Mill responded to it?
What is Mill’s justification (his “Proof”) for the principle of utility?
Why can it be problematic to aggregate utility? Provide an example.
How could advocating for perfect impartiality be a problem for utilitarianism?
What does utilitarianism say about keeping promises?
According to some moral theories, very demanding actions (e.g. saving someone from a fire at great risk to one’s own life), while moral, are not absolutely required actions from a moral point of view – it is not wrong to fail to perform them. They are called supererogatory actions (i.e. beyond the call of duty). Are there supererogatory actions in utilitarianism? Explain (keep in mind Singer’s arguments in “Famine, Affluence and Morality”)
Punishment can produce utility through rehabilitation, deterrence or vengeance. Point out morally problematic aspects with each of these, within the framework of utilitarianism (consider the actions it could recommend)
 

# Final 
Lecs 6 and 7 Kant

Can an action be right (e.g. correct), but have no moral worth, according to Kant? Explain.
Are actions performed from inclination wrong, according to Kant? Explain.
Does an action performed out of kindness have moral worth, according to Kant? Explain.
Explain the difference between a hypothetical and a categorical imperative.
Is a hypothetical imperative a command of reason? Explain.
What is Kant’s view on pleasure? Does Kant deny the claim that humans desire pleasure? Explain.
What is a maxim, and how can it be tested, according to Kant?
Explain under what circumstances Kant will consider there is a “contradiction in conception” when universalizing a maxim
What does it mean to universalize a maxim in the context of the application of the first formulation of the Categorical Imperative?
What is a perfect duty? What is an imperfect duty?
The humanity formula states: “Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other never simply as a means, but always at the same time, as an end”. Is it OK to treat someone as a means, if you also treat them as an end? Explain.
Why is Kant against suicide? Explain.
Explain Kant’s autonomy formula: “Act so that through your maxims you could be a legislator of universal laws”
What does it mean to act heteronomously?
If we must follow the moral law, can we be truly moral and free, according to Kant? Explain.
 

Lecs 8 and 9 - Virtue Ethics

What is the anti-codifiability thesis of virtue ethics?
Why do we need virtues and practical reason, according to Aristotle? Use an example to explain, showing you understand the roles of each.
Which dispositions are virtues? How can we identify them?
What does it mean to say that virtuous action is in one’s true interest, according to Hume? (Does it mean we should all be selfish?) Explain.
How does Aristotle explain the fact that sometimes we don’t find it pleasurable to act morally?
Does Aristotle say that an incontinent person feels bad when they act morally? Explain.
Why does Hume say that there’s no fight between the emotions and reason
According to Hume, can we be motivated by a belief to do the right thing? Explain.
Why do we say that for Hume reason is means-end reasoning?
What is the difference between Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia and happiness (in the everyday sense the word “happiness” is used - a feeling of pleasure or contentment)?
 

Lec 10 – Rawls and Nozick

What is the veil of ignorance and why is it necessary?
How does Rawls suggest we deal with inequality? Elaborate, relating it to one of his principles.
What does Rawls think about meritocracy?
What are Rawls’ two principles of distributive justice?
What is the difference principle?
Consider the statement: “According to Rawls' theory of justice, a system in which there is inequality in the distribution of goods is not a just system.” Is this true? Explain.
Is agreement a sufficient condition for a contract to be fair, according to Rawls? Explain.
How does Nozick see charity?
Briefly explain Rawls’ argument that we should allow the “fast runner” to take advantage of his ability. You’ll need to explain the metaphor.
Discuss one important advantage of libertarianism over utilitarianism
Why does Nozick say that it’s not appropriate to have a time-slice approach to distributive justice?
Does Nozick speak against the existence of a state? Explain.
Outline and explain the importance of Nozick’s two principles that justify entitlement to a holding.
Outline two objections that Rawls would make to Nozick's entitlement theory of justice.
Lec 11 - Friedman - Shareholder theory

Why does Adam Smith say this: “I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good”?
Is Friedman right in saying that a CEO’s only responsibility is to maximize profits? Explain.
Friedman says the corporate executive must make as much money as possible while confirming with basic rules of society (law and “ethical custom”). Does his argument about the basic rules of society support or undermine his argument about the duties of the executive? Discuss.
What does Friedman say of actions “under the cloak of social responsibility”?
Friedman seems to imply that a mark of acts of (genuine) social responsibility is that they hurt the bottom line. Is this true? Why or why not?
Lec 12 - Solomon and Stakeholder Theory

When Solomon asks for a more personal dimension in Business Ethics, does he mean that we should act on subjective/relativist values? Explain
Does Solomon agree with Aristotle’s zero-sum view on “trade for profit”? Explain this view, and then describe Solomon's position.
Outline the holistic approach espoused by Solomon, and explain how it’s different from the view that “people in business are parasites” and that “business is business”
Why does Solomon argue that there’s “no split of antagonism between individual self-interest and the public good” (p. 322)?
Why does Solomon criticize the Kantian and utilitarian approaches to business ethics?
Discuss the importance of integrity and role identity in Business Ethics, according to Solomon
In what ways is a corporation like a polis?
Briefly explain how stakeholder theory differs from Friedman’s shareholder theory, then explain who’s right and why.
What does Solomon mean when he says that we need to get our "dual-citizenship" right?
