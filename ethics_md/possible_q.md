# **Lecture 1 – Moral Reasoning**

#### **What is validity?**
- A **valid argument** is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. It concerns the form of the argument, not the truth of the premises or conclusion.

#### **What is soundness?**
- A **sound argument** is a valid argument with **all true premises**. Therefore, it also has a true conclusion.

#### **What is an empirical argument?**
- An **empirical argument** is based on observable evidence or experience. It draws conclusions from facts that can be confirmed or falsified through data.

#### **What is a conceptual argument?**
- A **conceptual argument** is based on the meaning of concepts or definitions (e.g. "A bachelor is unmarried by definition").

#### **What is a moral/value argument?**
- A **moral or value argument** involves a **normative claim**—what one ought to do, or what is good, bad, right, or wrong. These arguments cannot be settled by empirical evidence alone.

#### **How to spot “trick” questions in moral reasoning?**
- Some questions may ask you to evaluate an invalid or unsound argument. You must recognize logical fallacies, invalid forms, or when a value claim is being treated as a factual one.

#### **Example of Valid but Unsound Argument:**
- Premise: All cats can fly.
- Premise: Garfield is a cat.
- Conclusion: Garfield can fly.
  - **Valid** because the structure ensures the conclusion follows.
  - **Unsound** because the first premise is false.

#### **Example of Sound Argument:**
- Premise: All humans are mortal.
- Premise: Socrates is a human.
- Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.
  - **Valid and sound**, since the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows.

# Lecture 2 – Conventional Morality (Kohlberg & Singer)

---

### **1. Name Kohlberg’s six stages of moral development and briefly describe each.**

**Level 1: Pre-conventional**
- **Stage 1: Obedience and Punishment Orientation**  
  Right and wrong are determined by what is punished. Moral reasoning is based on avoiding punishment.

- **Stage 2: Instrumental Relativist Orientation**  
  Morality is based on self-interest and equal exchange ("You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours").

**Level 2: Conventional**
- **Stage 3: Good Interpersonal Relationships**  
  Morality is about living up to expectations and maintaining relationships ("Be a good boy/girl").

- **Stage 4: Maintaining Social Order**  
  Morality involves obeying laws and fulfilling one’s duty to keep society functioning. Law and order become central.

**Level 3: Post-conventional**
- **Stage 5: Social Contract and Individual Rights**  
  Laws are social contracts that should promote the greatest good; unjust laws should be changed democratically.

- **Stage 6: Universal Ethical Principles**  
  Morality is based on abstract principles (justice, equality, human rights) that may override laws.

---

### **2. Can it be problematic to remain in the law and order stage (Stage 4)? Why?**

Yes. Stage 4 emphasizes obedience to the law, even when laws are unjust. If one never moves beyond this stage, they might support harmful systems simply because they are legal. For example, slavery and apartheid were legal but morally wrong. Remaining in this stage can prevent moral progress.

---

### **3. What is the conventional level of moral development, and why is it not the final level? (Relate to Singer’s “All Animals Are Equal”)**

The **conventional level** (Stages 3 and 4) involves conformity to societal norms and law. It’s **not final** because:
- It depends on existing social norms, which may be unjust.
- It discourages critical thinking about morality itself.

**Singer** argues that moral progress requires challenging societal norms, like extending moral consideration to animals. Someone at Stage 5 or 6 is more likely to recognize speciesism as unjust.

---

### **4. Why does Kohlberg describe a Stage 6 of moral development? Shouldn’t Stage 5 (democratic reform) be enough?**

Kohlberg includes **Stage 6** to represent moral reasoning based on **principles of justice** that transcend laws. Stage 5 allows changing laws democratically, but Stage 6:
- Appeals to **universal principles** (e.g., human dignity) even when democratic processes fail.
- For example, a Stage 6 thinker might engage in **civil disobedience** if laws violate core ethical principles.

Thus, Stage 6 justifies **acting against the law** when laws violate moral truths.

---
# Lecture 3 – Relativism


### **1. Distinguish descriptive ethical relativism from normative ethical relativism.**

- **Descriptive ethical relativism**:  
  The empirical claim that different cultures or individuals **have different moral beliefs**.

- **Normative ethical relativism**:  
  The moral theory that there are **no objective moral truths**, and what is morally right or wrong **depends on cultural or individual beliefs**.

---

### **2. Distinguish objectivism from absolutism.**

- **Objectivism**:  
  The view that **some moral truths are universal** and apply to all people, regardless of culture or opinion. These truths can **allow exceptions based on context**.

- **Absolutism**:  
  A **stricter** form of objectivism that holds that **moral rules have no exceptions**—they apply in all situations, no matter the context.

> Example: An objectivist may say lying is generally wrong but justified to save a life; an absolutist says lying is **always** wrong.

---

### **3. Is it true that only a relativist can be tolerant? Explain why this is not true.**

No, this is **not true**.  
An **objectivist** can also **value tolerance** as a moral principle. In fact, if relativism means every belief is equally valid, then **intolerant beliefs would also be valid** under relativism.  
Therefore, **relativism can't guarantee tolerance**, and objectivism can **justify** it as an objective moral virtue.

---

### **4. Suppose a normative moral relativist argues that “out of respect and tolerance, we ought not to criticize other cultures.” Why is it problematic to argue this?**

It’s **self-contradictory**:
- If all moral values are relative, then the value of **tolerance** is also just one cultural value.
- Therefore, the relativist **cannot universally require** others to be tolerant, as that would be **an objective moral claim**.

> It assumes an objective moral duty (to tolerate), which contradicts relativism.

---

### **5. Identify two important arguments that can be raised against normative ethical relativism. Briefly discuss.**

1. **Moral progress becomes impossible**:  
   If cultures determine morality, then **no culture can ever improve**. Practices like slavery or genocide can't be criticized or seen as moral failures.

2. **It undermines moral criticism of injustice**:  
   If morality is entirely relative, then we **cannot judge** practices like **torture or oppression** in other cultures—or even in our own.

> Relativism **disables cross-cultural and internal moral critique**, which is essential for justice and reform.

# Lec 4 & 5 — Utilitarianism

**1. Does utilitarianism ask us to maximize happiness for the majority (over 50%)? Explain.**  
No. Utilitarianism asks us to maximize overall utility (pleasure, happiness, or well-being), not just for the majority. It considers everyone's interests equally, even if helping a minority creates more overall happiness.

**2. Does utilitarianism ask us to do what causes more pleasure than pain? Explain.**  
Not necessarily. Utilitarianism asks us to maximize net utility (overall good), which could mean minimizing pain or maximizing something else if we follow Mill's version (e.g. intellectual pleasure or well-being). "More pleasure than pain" is oversimplified.

**3. How can utilitarians know what to do, if moral evaluation is based on the actual consequences of actions they haven’t done yet?**  
Utilitarians use expected consequences, not actual. They assess likely outcomes based on evidence, reasoning, and experience. Rule utilitarianism helps mitigate this problem by following rules that tend to lead to good outcomes.

**4. Does utilitarianism advocate justice (e.g., fairness, contracts, etc.)? Explain.**  
Not inherently. If breaking a contract produces more utility, then a utilitarian may say it is the right action. Justice is instrumental, not intrinsic, unless following it consistently leads to greater utility.

**5. What arguments can be raised against normative hedonism?**  
- Pleasure is not the only intrinsic good (e.g. knowledge, love, autonomy).
- Some pleasures are morally problematic (e.g. sadistic pleasure).
- It reduces morality to feelings and overlooks rights and duties.

**6. Mill’s quality vs Bentham’s quantity of pleasure — advantages and disadvantages?**  
- **Advantage**: Accounts for higher-order pleasures (e.g. reading vs eating).
- **Disadvantage**: Hard to objectively measure quality; introduces subjectivity and elitism.

**7. “Too high for humanity” objection & Mill’s response:**  
**Objection**: Utilitarianism demands saint-like behavior.  
**Mill**: No—most people aren’t required to maximize global utility at all times. Promoting happiness can involve fulfilling ordinary duties.

**8. “Doctrine of swine” objection & Mill’s response:**  
**Objection**: Reduces humans to animals seeking pleasure.  
**Mill**: Human pleasures are of higher quality. It's better to be a dissatisfied human than a satisfied pig.

**9. “Lack of time” objection & Mill’s response:**  
**Objection**: We don’t have time to calculate consequences.  
**Mill**: We use secondary principles and rules of thumb that have been tested over time.

**10. Mill’s “Proof” for the principle of utility?**  
We desire happiness, so happiness is desirable. Things are good as means or parts of happiness. This is a psychological (not deductive) proof.

**11. Why can it be problematic to aggregate utility?**  
It can justify sacrificing a few for many, even if it’s unjust (e.g. framing an innocent person). It treats individuals as utility carriers, not moral agents.

**12. How could perfect impartiality be a problem?**  
It requires treating strangers the same as loved ones, which is unrealistic and morally counterintuitive.

**13. What does utilitarianism say about keeping promises?**  
Only keep promises if doing so maximizes utility. Breaking a promise is permissible if it produces better consequences.

**14. Are there supererogatory actions in utilitarianism?**  
No. All morally good actions are obligatory if they maximize utility. Singer argues that helping others is a duty, not “above and beyond.”

**15. Punishment and utility — moral problems:**  
- **Rehabilitation**: May treat people as means if it's only to change them.  
- **Deterrence**: Risk of punishing innocents to deter others.  
- **Vengeance**: Not utility-focused and encourages cruelty.  
Utilitarianism may justify morally questionable punishments if they increase utility.

Here are the **answers for Lecture 6 (Kant – Part I)**:

---

# Lec 6 & 7 — Kantian Ethics

**1. Can an action be right (e.g. correct), but have no moral worth, according to Kant? Explain.**  
Yes. An action can conform to duty (i.e., be the right thing to do) but lack moral worth if it’s done from inclination (e.g., self-interest) rather than from duty. For Kant, moral worth arises only when the action is done **from duty**.

**2. Are actions performed from inclination wrong, according to Kant? Explain.**  
Not necessarily. Actions from inclination are not morally wrong, but they lack **moral worth** unless done from duty. For example, helping someone because you enjoy it is not blameworthy—but it is not praiseworthy in Kant’s moral sense.

**3. Does an action performed out of kindness have moral worth, according to Kant?**  
Only if the kindness stems from **duty**, not from personal feeling. If someone helps others purely because they feel like it, the action lacks moral worth. But if they help others because it is their **duty**, then it does have moral worth.

**4. Explain the difference between a hypothetical and a categorical imperative.**  
- **Hypothetical imperative**: Conditional. “If you want X, then you must do Y.” It applies only if you have the relevant desire.
- **Categorical imperative**: Unconditional. “You must do Y.” Applies to all rational agents regardless of desires.

**5. Is a hypothetical imperative a command of reason? Explain.**  
Yes, but it is **instrumental reason**. It tells you what means to choose if you will a certain end. It does not command morally, only practically.

**6. What is Kant’s view on pleasure? Does Kant deny the claim that humans desire pleasure? Explain.**  
No, Kant acknowledges that humans seek pleasure. But he **doesn’t base morality on pleasure**. Pleasure is not the basis of moral law or moral worth—**duty** is.

**7. What is a maxim, and how can it be tested, according to Kant?**  
A **maxim** is a subjective principle of action (what you're doing and why). It is tested through **universalization**: Can you will it as a universal law without contradiction?

**8. Explain under what circumstances Kant will consider there is a “contradiction in conception” when universalizing a maxim.**  
A contradiction in conception occurs when, if universalized, the maxim **destroys the very practice** it relies on. E.g., a maxim to lie to get out of trouble would, if universalized, eliminate trust and the institution of truth-telling.

**9. What does it mean to universalize a maxim in the context of the application of the first formulation of the Categorical Imperative?**  
To test if the maxim could be **willed as a universal law of nature** that everyone acts on. If the maxim can’t be universalized without contradiction, then it is morally impermissible.

**10. What is a perfect duty? What is an imperfect duty?**  
- **Perfect duty**: Always required, no exceptions (e.g., don’t lie, don’t kill).
- **Imperfect duty**: Must be followed but allows **flexibility** in how/when (e.g., help others, develop your talents).


**1. The humanity formula states: “Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.” Is it OK to treat someone as a means if you also treat them as an end? Explain.**  
Yes, **Kant allows** treating others as a means **as long as** they are also treated as **ends in themselves**. For example, hiring someone to do a job is fine if done with **respect for their autonomy**, not deception or coercion.

---

**2. Why is Kant against suicide? Explain.**  
Suicide treats the self as **a mere means** to escape suffering, **violating the humanity formula**. It undermines the rational nature and dignity of a person, which must be respected even in oneself.

---

**3. Explain Kant’s autonomy formula: “Act so that through your maxims you could be a legislator of universal laws.”**  
This means that you should only act on principles (maxims) that you would rationally will as laws for **all rational beings**. It emphasizes that morality arises from **rational self-governance**, not external authority.

---

**4. What does it mean to act heteronomously?**  
To act **heteronomously** is to act according to **external influences** (desires, inclinations, social pressures) rather than by one’s **own rational will**. Heteronomous actions **lack moral autonomy** and are not truly free in Kant’s moral sense.

---

**5. If we must follow the moral law, can we be truly moral and free, according to Kant? Explain.**  
Yes. For Kant, **true freedom** is **autonomy**—acting according to a law you give yourself through reason. When you act from the moral law, you are not being externally controlled but **fully expressing your rational nature**.

Great! Here are the **answers for Lecture 8 – Virtue Ethics I**:

---

# Lec 8 & 9 — Virtue Ethics 

**1. What is the anti-codifiability thesis of virtue ethics?**  
Virtue Ethics (VE) argues that **moral knowledge cannot be reduced to a set of rules or codes**. Morality is a skill—like playing an instrument or writing poetry—and requires **practical wisdom (phronesis)** and character, not just following universal laws.

---

**2. Why do we need virtues and practical reason, according to Aristotle? Use an example.**  
Virtues are emotional dispositions; **practical reason** (phronesis) helps us **apply the right virtue in the right way** in a specific situation.  
*Example:* Suppose a friend is lying to protect someone. You must decide whether **honesty or loyalty** should guide your action. This requires judgment, not just rules.

---

**3. Which dispositions are virtues? How can we identify them?**  
According to Aristotle, a virtue is a **mean between two vices** (excess and deficiency).  
*Example:* Courage lies between cowardice and recklessness.  
Hume adds that a virtue is a **useful emotional disposition** for oneself and others—like generosity or loyalty—especially when consistently applied.

---

**4. What does it mean to say that virtuous action is in one’s true interest, according to Hume?**  
Hume argues that being virtuous is in one’s **true interest**—not selfishness, but fulfilling **real human needs** (e.g. friendship, trust, reputation). Virtue promotes social bonds, leading to long-term benefits and self-respect.

---

**5. How does Aristotle explain the fact that sometimes we don’t find it pleasurable to act morally?**  
Because we are **not yet fully virtuous**. When there's a conflict (e.g. being generous but not wanting to share), it shows we're **continent** but not yet perfectly virtuous. With moral education, we **learn to enjoy virtue**.

---

**6. Does Aristotle say that an incontinent person feels bad when they act morally? Explain.**  
No—the **incontinent person fails to act morally** even when they know what is right. They are overwhelmed by competing desires and feel **regret** afterward. Their will is weak; they lack mastery over emotions.

---

**7. Why does Hume say that there’s no fight between the emotions and reason?**  
Because **reason alone cannot motivate action**. It only identifies means to achieve ends. All motivation comes from **passions or desires**, so moral struggles are **conflicts between competing passions**, not between reason and emotion.

---

**8. According to Hume, can we be motivated by a belief to do the right thing? Explain.**  
No—**beliefs alone cannot motivate**. You must also have a **desire** (e.g. desire to help someone + belief that giving money helps = motivation to help). Without desire, belief does nothing motivationally.

---

**9. Why do we say that for Hume, reason is means-end reasoning?**  
Because **reason helps identify the best way to achieve a goal**, but it **doesn’t tell us which goals to have**. Desires define ends; reason chooses efficient means.

---

**10. What is the difference between Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia and happiness (in the everyday sense)?**  
Eudaimonia means **flourishing or living well**, not just feeling good. It’s a **life of virtuous activity**, health, friendship, and purpose—not just **pleasure or mood** like ordinary happiness.


Here are the **answers for Lecture 9 – Virtue Ethics II**:

---

**1. What is Aristotle’s position on whether we can reason about ends?**  
Aristotle seems to **say both yes and no**:

- He **initially says** we only reason about **means to ends** (like Hume).
- But elsewhere, he clearly says we can **deliberate about virtues and fine-tune them** (e.g. “What does loyalty demand here?”).
  
So we **do** reason about ends—but not ultimate ends like **eudaimonia**, which are fixed. We **reason about how to live virtuously** to achieve those ends.

---

**2. What role does practical reason (phronesis) play in Aristotle’s virtue ethics?**  
Phronesis is **practical wisdom**. It helps determine:

- **Which virtue applies** in a specific situation.
- **How to balance competing virtues** (e.g. loyalty vs fairness).

Example: Helping a friend (loyalty) vs reporting them for misconduct (justice). You need phronesis to know what the **right action** is.

---

**3. What is the difference between being continent and perfectly virtuous?**  
- The **continent person** knows what’s right but feels a conflict (temptation) and **does the right thing anyway**.
- The **perfectly virtuous person** acts morally **with no internal conflict**—they naturally desire to do the right thing and take pleasure in it.

---

**4. What are the two types of incontinence Aristotle describes?**  
- **Weak incontinence**: You deliberate, know what’s right, but fail to do it due to a strong desire.
- **Impetuous incontinence**: You **don’t deliberate**—you act on impulse and only realize afterward that you acted wrongly.

---

**5. Why does Hume distinguish between natural and artificial virtues?**  
- **Natural virtues** (e.g. benevolence, loyalty) arise **naturally** through social bonds.
- **Artificial virtues** (e.g. justice) require **social learning** and **institutions** to develop. We **learn them** because they are **socially useful**.

---

**6. What is the steady and general point of view in Hume’s ethics?**  
It’s Hume’s way of **correcting personal bias**. To judge moral actions fairly, we must:

- **Discount our self-interest**
- **Adopt a general perspective**, like an impartial observer

This allows **shared moral discourse** and **social cohesion**.

---

**7. How can Hume’s view of reason still support moral improvement?**  
Though reason doesn’t motivate, it helps us **identify emotional biases** and **cultivate better dispositions**.  
Example: You may feel anger at someone, but reason helps you reflect, adopt a general viewpoint, and **develop forgiveness** as a virtue.

---

**8. Why does virtue ethics reject moral rules as a complete guide to action?**  
VE supports the **anti-codifiability thesis**—rules are too general. Real-life situations require **judgment** and **character**.  
Example: Rules can’t tell you how generous to be in every situation. Virtue and phronesis are needed.

---

**9. How can someone improve their character, according to Aristotle?**  
Through **moral education**:

- Children learn the “**that**” (e.g. stealing is wrong) by repetition and habit.
- Later, they learn the “**why**” through **practical reason**.
  
Over time, this develops into stable **virtues**.

---

**10. What is Aristotle’s view on moral responsibility?**  
We’re **responsible for our character** because:

- We **choose our actions**, which form our habits.
- Even if we were ignorant or drunk, we **chose to be** in that state.

So we can’t use character flaws as excuses for immoral actions.

---

**11. Does virtue ethics allow moral learning even for the non-virtuous?**  
Yes. Even someone who is **incontinent** (knows what’s right but fails) can improve by:

- **Reflecting on their failures**
- **Using VE guidelines**
- **Building better habits**

Though change is hard, VE encourages **moral development**.

Here are the **answers for Lecture 10 – Rawls and Nozick**:

---

# Lec 10 — Rawls and Nozick: Theories of Justice



**1. What is the veil of ignorance and why is it necessary?**  
It’s a thought experiment where individuals choose principles of justice **without knowing their status in society** (e.g. rich or poor, race, gender).  
It ensures **fairness and impartiality**, because no one can design principles that only benefit their own position.

---

**2. How does Rawls suggest we deal with inequality? Relate to one of his principles.**  
Through the **Difference Principle** (part of Rawls’ second principle):  
Inequalities are only acceptable **if they benefit the least advantaged** in society.  
So inequality is permitted, but only when it helps everyone, especially the worst-off.

---

**3. What does Rawls think about meritocracy?**  
He criticizes meritocracy as unfair:

- Even **talent and effort** are influenced by **luck**, family, birth order, and upbringing.
- So meritocracy still rewards people for **morally arbitrary advantages**.

Rawls argues we should **do better** than meritocracy by applying the **Difference Principle**.

---

**4. What are Rawls’ two principles of distributive justice?**  
1. **Equal basic liberties** for all (e.g. speech, conscience, property)  
2. **Social and economic inequalities** must:
   - A) Benefit everyone, especially the **least advantaged** (**Difference Principle**), and  
   - B) Be attached to positions open to all (**fair equality of opportunity**)

---

**5. What is the Difference Principle?**  
It allows inequality **only if** it improves the condition of the **least well-off**.  
E.g. higher pay for doctors is okay **if** their work improves health for everyone.

---

**6. Is the statement “Rawls says inequality is always unjust” true?**  
No. Rawls allows inequality **if** it meets the **Difference Principle** and **Fair Opportunity** condition.  
So not all inequality is unjust—only **unfair or arbitrary** inequality is.

---

**7. Is agreement a sufficient condition for a contract to be fair, according to Rawls?**  
No. **Consent alone is not enough**.  
A fair contract also requires **equal bargaining power** and **reciprocal benefit**.  
E.g. accepting a low wage due to desperation is **not truly fair**, even if you agreed.

---

**8. How does Nozick see charity?**  
Charity should be **voluntary**.  
It’s good if you choose to help, but it’s **not a moral requirement**.  
Government **shouldn’t coerce** people into helping others (e.g. through taxation for redistribution).

---

**9. Briefly explain Rawls’ “fast runner” metaphor.**  
Fast runners (talented individuals) **can benefit** from their gifts **only if** they help the slowest runners.  
In society: People with advantages (intelligence, wealth) can benefit **if** they help the least advantaged.

---

**10. One advantage of libertarianism over utilitarianism?**  
Libertarianism **respects individual rights** more strictly.  
Utilitarianism may allow **sacrificing one** for the majority’s good, but libertarians oppose this.  
Example: You **can’t kill one innocent** person to save five.

---

**11. Why does Nozick reject time-slice approaches to justice?**  
Because they ignore **how** distributions came to be.  
Justice depends on **history**—who acquired what and **how**.  
You can’t just look at the current distribution and declare it just/unjust.

---

**12. Does Nozick speak against the existence of a state?**  
No. Nozick **accepts a minimal state**, which protects rights (police, courts, military).  
But any state that goes beyond this (e.g. redistributes wealth) is **unjust**.

---

**13. Nozick’s two principles for entitlement to a holding:**  
1. **Justice in acquisition** – you justly acquired it (no theft, coercion)  
2. **Justice in transfer** – it was voluntarily exchanged (no fraud, manipulation)  
(+ Rectification principle: to correct past injustices)

---

**14. Two Rawlsian objections to Nozick’s entitlement theory:**  
1. **Moral arbitrariness**: Nozick ignores that natural talent and social background are unearned  
2. **Ignores the social contract**: A just society needs fair starting conditions, not just fair transfers.

Here are the **answers for Lecture 11 – Friedman and Shareholder Theory**:

---

# Lec 11 — Milton Friedman and Shareholder Theory

---

**1. Why does Adam Smith say: “I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good”?**  
Because he believed **pursuing self-interest** in a free market **inadvertently benefits the public** more than when someone **tries to help the public directly** through trade.  
This is the idea of the **invisible hand** — individuals pursuing profit unintentionally contribute to societal good.

---

**2. Is Friedman right in saying that a CEO’s only responsibility is to maximize profits? Explain.**  
Friedman says CEOs are **agents** of shareholders and have a **fiduciary duty** to maximize profits **within legal and ethical limits**.  
Critics argue:
- This **ignores responsibilities** to other stakeholders (e.g. employees, customers, environment)
- Focusing solely on profits may **harm long-term trust** and societal well-being  
So while there is some truth to Friedman’s view, **stakeholder theory offers a broader ethical approach**.

---

**3. Friedman says the corporate executive must make as much money as possible while conforming with basic rules of society (law and “ethical custom”). Does this support or undermine his argument?**  
It **undermines** his strict view.  
If executives must conform to **ethical customs**, then **ethics matters**, and not just profit.  
This opens the door to **social responsibility** beyond mere legal compliance.

---

**4. What does Friedman say of actions “under the cloak of social responsibility”?**  
He’s **skeptical**.  
He believes some companies use **social responsibility** as a **PR strategy**, but are **really pursuing long-term profits**.  
He warns that pretending to act ethically when the true motive is profit **undermines capitalism** and **confuses moral categories**.

---

**5. Friedman seems to imply that a mark of acts of (genuine) social responsibility is that they hurt the bottom line. Is this true? Why or why not?**  
Not necessarily.  
Critics argue that **socially responsible actions often help the bottom line** (e.g. building customer trust, avoiding lawsuits, enhancing reputation).  
Friedman **dismisses this** as just long-term profit-seeking—but this blurs the line between **genuine ethics and strategic ethics**.  
So, actions can be **both ethical and profitable**; hurting the bottom line isn’t required for them to be truly ethical.

Great! Here are the **answers for Lecture 12 – Solomon and Stakeholder Theory**:

---

# Lecture 12 — Solomon and Stakeholder Theory

---

**1. When Solomon asks for a more personal dimension in Business Ethics, does he mean that we should act on subjective/relativist values? Explain.**  
No. Solomon does **not** promote relativism or subjectivism.  
He believes ethics should be **contextual** and **rooted in one's role within a community or corporation**, not based on **personal whim**.  
He promotes **virtue ethics** — developing character traits that align with one’s professional and social roles.

---

**2. Does Solomon agree with Aristotle’s zero-sum view on “trade for profit”? Explain this view, and then describe Solomon's position.**  
Aristotle viewed trade for profit as **greedy and parasitic**, a **zero-sum game**.  
Solomon **rejects** this.  
He sees business as a **collaborative, community-oriented endeavor** where people can **pursue excellence and contribute to mutual flourishing**.  
He reclaims **business virtues** like integrity, loyalty, and even toughness as **genuine ethical traits**.

---

**3. Outline the holistic approach espoused by Solomon, and explain how it’s different from the view that “people in business are parasites” and that “business is business.”**  
Solomon’s **holistic approach** emphasizes that **business life and personal life cannot be separated**.  
You must bring your **whole ethical self** to work.  
This contrasts with:
- “Business is business”: Treats business as **ethically neutral**  
- “Parasites”: Suggests business is **inherently unethical**  
Solomon rejects both and proposes that **ethics is essential for doing business well**.

---

**4. Why does Solomon argue that there’s “no split of antagonism between individual self-interest and the public good” (p. 322)?**  
Because in a well-functioning business environment, **self-interest and public interest are aligned**.  
Being **honest, respectful, and responsible** helps both the **individual and the community thrive**.  
Solomon uses **Aristotelian virtue ethics** to show that personal excellence and community well-being are **interdependent**.

---

**5. Why does Solomon criticize the Kantian and utilitarian approaches to business ethics?**  
- **Kant** is criticized for being **too rigid and abstract**, failing to inspire real-world decision-making in business  
- **Utilitarianism** is seen as **too calculative and impersonal**, neglecting the development of **moral character**  
Solomon prefers a **virtue-based** approach that focuses on **personal responsibility and judgment** within one’s role.

**6. Discuss the importance of integrity and role identity in Business Ethics, according to Solomon.**  
- **Integrity**: Not just stubbornness, but **moral wholeness** and courage to do the right thing even under pressure  
- **Role identity**: Your ethical duties are **part of your role** (e.g. CEO, employee, manager). Ethics in business is **role-dependent**  
Solomon argues that recognizing one’s **ethical obligations within their role** is **key to ethical behavior**.

**8. Briefly explain how stakeholder theory differs from Friedman’s shareholder theory, then explain who’s right and why.**  
- **Shareholder theory (Friedman)**: Company’s only responsibility is to **maximize shareholder profit**  
- **Stakeholder theory**: Companies must consider the **interests of all stakeholders** (employees, customers, environment, etc.)  
Stakeholder theory is more **ethically robust** and aligns better with **long-term success and moral responsibility**.

**9. What does Solomon mean when he says that we need to get our "dual-citizenship" right?**  
We are **citizens of both**:  
- The **corporation** (with professional roles and responsibilities)  
- The **larger society** (with civic duties and ethical values)  
Getting our **"dual-citizenship" right** means ensuring our **business roles and ethical values are integrated**, not in conflict.
