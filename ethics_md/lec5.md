### **Lecture 5: Dark Patterns in UX Design & Objections to Utilitarianism**  

This lecture addresses two major topics:  
1. **Dark patterns in UX design** – How design choices can manipulate users.  
2. **Objections to utilitarianism** – Why some philosophers argue that utilitarianism is flawed.  

---

## **1. Dark Patterns in UX Design: Ethics & Manipulation**  

Dark patterns refer to **manipulative UX (User Experience) design strategies** that trick users into making decisions they wouldn’t otherwise make.  

### **Legal Status of Dark Patterns**  
- **USA:** Considered unfair and deceptive by the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** (2021).  
- **EU:** Recognized as a violation of consumer protection laws (2022).  
- **Canada:** No explicit regulation yet, but laws like **PIPEDA** and **CASL** address some aspects.  

> **Key Idea:** Just because something is **legal** doesn’t mean it’s **ethical**.  

---

### **2. Ethical Manipulation? Consent & Avuncular Ethics**  

Some forms of UX design guide users toward **beneficial choices** (e.g., saving for retirement).  

#### **Examples of "Good" Manipulation:**  
1. **Default Options for Retirement Plans**  
   - *Scenario:* Employees are automatically enrolled in a pension plan unless they opt out.  
   - *Ethical Justification:* This increases financial security without forcing anyone.  

2. **Insurance Opt-In via Visual Design**  
   - *Scenario:* A user must **actively** decline essential travel insurance.  
   - *Ethical Concern:* This is more manipulative than the pension plan example.  

> **Kantian Ethics:** All manipulation is unethical.  
> **Utilitarian Ethics:** Manipulation is **acceptable** if it **maximizes happiness**.

## **3. Reviewing Utilitarianism: Misinterpretations & Clarifications**  

Many students **misunderstand utilitarianism**. Some common errors:  

❌ **“Utilitarianism maximizes happiness for the majority.”**  
✔ **Correction:** It maximizes **total** happiness, not just for the majority.  

❌ **“An action is right if the benefits outweigh the costs.”**  
✔ **Correction:** The action must **maximize** happiness—other actions may have benefits, but they aren’t the **best** option.  

❌ **“Respecting contracts maximizes utility, so we should always respect contracts.”**  
✔ **Correction:** Utilitarianism doesn’t follow absolute rules. A contract can be broken **if** doing so maximizes utility.  

❌ **“An action is right because it causes happiness.”**  
✔ **Correction:** The **Greatest Happiness Principle** states that actions are right **in proportion** to their ability to maximize happiness.  

> **Key Point:** Utilitarianism is **not about following rules—it evaluates individual actions based on their outcomes.**  

---

## **4. Objections to Utilitarianism (Mill’s Responses)**  

John Stuart Mill addressed **three common objections**:  

### **1. Doctrine of Swine**  
**Objection:**  
- If pleasure is the only good, then utilitarianism treats humans like animals (who only seek pleasure).  

**Mill’s Response:**  
- **Higher pleasures (intellectual, moral) are superior** to lower (physical) pleasures.  
- **Competent judges** (people who have experienced both types of pleasure) can determine which is better.  

**Criticism of Mill:**  
- Who decides what is a "higher" pleasure?  
- Does this introduce **elitism** into utilitarianism?  

---

### **2. Too High for Humanity**  
**Objection:**  
- It’s unrealistic to expect people to always act for the general good rather than personal motives.  

**Mill’s Response:**  
- Ethics tells us **what our duties are**, not what our motivations should be.  
- People can act in ways that **coincidentally maximize happiness**, even if they aren’t thinking about it.  

**Criticism of Mill:**  
- Are moral actions truly moral if people aren’t motivated by morality?  

---

### **3. Lack of Time**  
**Objection:**  
- People don’t have time to calculate happiness before every action.  

**Mill’s Response:**  
- People can rely on **moral rules** based on past experiences (e.g., “lying usually causes harm”).  
- We don’t need to calculate every decision from scratch.  

**Criticism of Mill:**  
- What if **past moral rules** don’t always apply to new situations?  

---

## **5. Additional Problems with Utilitarianism**  

Even if Mill’s responses hold, **other problems remain**:  

### **1. Nozick’s Experience Machine (Challenge to Hedonism)**  
**Scenario:**  
- You can enter a machine that gives you the illusion of the best possible life.  
- Would you choose it?  

**Nozick’s Argument:**  
- We want **real achievements**, not just the illusion of happiness.  
- **Happiness alone is not the ultimate goal.**  

---

### **2. Aggregating Utility (Violating Individual Rights?)**  
**Scenario:**  
- A dark pattern tricks a user into sharing private photos.  
- Later, the FBI uses these photos to **catch a criminal**.  

**Utilitarian Verdict:**  
✔ **Moral** (it maximized happiness).  

**Criticism:**  
- Should violating privacy be justified just because it **happened to lead to a good outcome**?  

---

### **3. Negative Responsibility (Are We Responsible for Inaction?)**  
**Scenario:**  
- A warlord captures 20 people.  
- You can **kill one** to save the other 19.  

**Utilitarian Verdict:**  
✔ **Moral** (1 death < 19 deaths).  

**Criticism:**  
- Are you really responsible for **not** killing someone?  
- Does utilitarianism justify **horrific acts** if they lead to a net gain in happiness?  

---

### **4. The Problem of Promises**  
**Scenario:**  
- A grandson promises his dying grandfather to **bury his body with respect**.  
- Later, the grandson is stranded on an island and must use the body as **bait to survive**.  

**Utilitarian Verdict:**  
✔ **Moral** (survival > promise).  

**Criticism:**  
- Should **all promises be broken** if it leads to **greater happiness**?  

---

### **5. Punishment & Justice**  
**Utilitarian Justifications for Punishment:**  
✔ **Rehabilitation** (help criminals reform).  
✔ **Deterrence** (prevent future crime).  
✔ **Vengeance** (brings satisfaction to victims).  

**Problems:**  
- **Framing innocent people** for crimes could be justified if it deters others.  
- **Mass punishment** (e.g., punishing 10 innocent people to ensure 1 guilty person is punished).  

> **Criticism:** Utilitarianism **ignores individual rights** in favor of total happiness.  

---

## **6. Demanding Perfect Impartiality (Singer’s Famine Argument)**  
- Peter Singer: If utilitarianism is true, then **helping others isn’t charity—it’s a duty.**  
- We should give to **starving children** as much as we would help **a drowning child**.  

**Objection:**  
- Does utilitarianism require us to **sacrifice everything** to maximize happiness?  
- Are we really expected to treat **strangers the same as family**?  

---

## **7. Summary: Key Issues with Utilitarianism**  

| **Objection** | **Utilitarian Response** | **Criticism** |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Doctrine of Swine** | Higher pleasures exist | Who decides what’s “higher”? |
| **Too High for Humanity** | Morality doesn’t require pure motives | Do motives matter for morality? |
| **Lack of Time** | We can rely on general moral rules | What if past rules don’t apply? |
| **Nozick’s Machine** | We want real experiences | Happiness isn’t the only good |
| **Negative Responsibility** | Not acting is just as bad | Does this justify horrible actions? |
| **Justice & Punishment** | Maximizes deterrence | Innocents could be punished |
| **Perfect Impartiality** | We must treat all equally | Is it wrong to prioritize family? |

---

## **8. Conclusion: Can Utilitarianism Work?**  

- **Can we give up social utility entirely?**  
- **Does maximizing happiness justify anything?**  
- **Should we balance utilitarianism with other moral theories (e.g., Kant’s duty-based ethics)?**  


# Case Study

### **Case Study Analysis: Utilitarianism and Dark Patterns**  
**(Lecture 5 – Utilitarianism II in UX and Marketing Ethics)**  

---

## **Case 1: Dark Patterns in E-Commerce (Emily’s Dilemma: Deceptive UX for Profitability)**  

### **1. Are the benefits to the company and other customers worth the harm caused to individuals like Alex?**  

- **Utilitarian Justification:**  
  - **Short-term benefits**: Increased revenue allows the company to **lower prices, improve services, and enhance employee benefits**, benefiting a larger group.  
  - **Company growth benefits many people**, including employees, investors, and some customers.  

- **Utilitarian Counterpoint:**  
  - **Harm to individuals**: Users like Alex suffer financial distress, which **reduces overall happiness**.  
  - **Deception undermines autonomy**: The **forced subscriptions create stress** and **limit freedom of choice**, a key factor in well-being.  
  - **Potential long-term backlash**: Customers who feel tricked may **abandon the company**, leading to **lower trust, negative reviews, and future revenue loss**.  

**Conclusion:** The short-term gains for some do not justify **manipulating and financially harming others**.  

---

### **2. How do manipulative design practices impact the trust between companies and their users?**  

- **Loss of Consumer Trust:**  
  - Users may **stop shopping at companies that employ deceptive tactics**.  
  - **Negative word-of-mouth and reputational damage** can lead to **customer loss** in the long term.  

- **Regulatory Consequences:**  
  - **Governments and consumer protection agencies are increasingly cracking down** on dark patterns.  
  - **Legal actions** (like lawsuits and fines) could **harm the company more than the temporary revenue boost helps it**.  

- **Ethical Implications:**  
  - Businesses that prioritize **short-term utility over fairness risk long-term failure**.  
  - Ethical UX design **enhances customer loyalty and sustainable growth**.  

**Conclusion:** Dark patterns may **increase short-term profits**, but they **ultimately erode trust and damage the company’s reputation**.  

---

### **3. Should companies prioritize profits and overall utility, even if it means exploiting customer behavior?**  

- **No, because exploitation reduces long-term utility.**  
- **Ethical Business Practices Matter:**  
  - Ethical companies that **respect customers gain trust and brand loyalty**, leading to **higher revenue over time**.  
  - **Using dark patterns is a form of short-sighted utilitarianism**—it ignores long-term harm.  

- **Practical Alternative:**  
  - Instead of **tricking customers**, companies can **use transparent marketing** and **fair UX design** while still improving sales.  

**Conclusion:** Manipulating users for profit **undermines ethical business practices** and ultimately reduces **long-term utility**.  

---

## **Case 2: Dark Patterns in a Fitness App (Laura’s Dilemma: Manipulative UX for Retention and Well-being)**  

### **1. Does the overall benefit of increased revenue and community support justify manipulating users like Megan?**  

- **Utilitarian Justification:**  
  - More revenue means the company can **offer more free trials and fund wellness programs**, benefiting society.  
  - Encouraging users to **stay subscribed may improve their long-term health**.  

- **Utilitarian Counterpoint:**  
  - **Megan is financially harmed**: She’s **paying for a service she does not use** due to manipulation.  
  - **Stress and frustration** reduce her well-being, which contradicts the fitness app’s goal.  
  - **Coerced decisions are not real choices**: **Forcing retention through guilt tactics undermines user autonomy**.  

**Conclusion:** The **harm to users outweighs** the benefits of **forced retention**.  

---

### **2. How do these design tactics impact the long-term relationship between the company and its users?**  

- **Negative Customer Experience:**  
  - Users **lose trust** and feel **resentment** towards the brand.  
  - **High churn rates over time**: Customers will eventually cancel once they realize they are being manipulated.  

- **Ethical and Legal Risks:**  
  - Regulatory bodies (like the **FTC, EU, and Canadian authorities**) are **cracking down on deceptive digital practices**.  
  - **Reputational damage** from unethical practices can **lead to lost partnerships and declining user base**.  

**Conclusion:** Trust-based retention is **more sustainable** than deception-based retention.  

---

### **3. Should companies be allowed to use manipulative designs if it leads to greater good, or is there a line that should not be crossed?**  

- **Companies should NOT be allowed to manipulate users for any reason.**  
- **Why?**  
  - **Short-term benefits do not justify unethical means**.  
  - **Exploitation undermines autonomy**, which is a key moral principle.  
  - **Encouraging fair practices leads to long-term success and user trust**.  

- **Where is the line?**  
  - **Encouraging users to stay engaged is acceptable**, but **trapping them in subscriptions is unethical**.  
  - **Providing clear and easy cancellation options** respects user choice.  

**Conclusion:** The **line is crossed when users are misled, tricked, or manipulated** into making choices **against their best interests**.  

---

## **Final Takeaways Across Both Cases**  

### **1. Dark Patterns Undermine Both Ethics and Long-Term Utility**  
- **Utilitarianism does NOT justify deception**, because **long-term harm outweighs short-term benefits**.  
- **Ethical business practices are more sustainable** and **generate greater long-term value**.  

### **2. Trust and Transparency Matter**  
- Deceptive practices **damage consumer trust** and can lead to **regulatory penalties and reputational damage**.  
- Companies **thrive when they respect their users’ autonomy and choices**.  

### **3. Practical Ethical Alternatives Exist**  
- **Improve user engagement without deception**.  
- **Use clear and fair UX design**, rather than **misleading users into financial harm**.  
- **Allow easy cancellation options** while providing incentives for users to stay.  

### **Final Verdict: The Greater Good Requires Ethical Means**  
- Companies **must not prioritize short-term gains at the expense of fairness and transparency**.  
- **Dark patterns are unethical, even when they generate economic benefits**.
