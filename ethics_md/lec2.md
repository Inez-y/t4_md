# **Lecture 2: Conventional Morality & Conflicts of Interest**

This lecture explores **conventional morality**, **conflicts of interest**, and **how moral reasoning develops**. It challenges the idea that **social norms define morality** and introduces **theories of moral development** from Piaget, Kohlberg, and Peter Singer.

---

## **1. Conflicts of Interest**
A **conflict of interest** occurs when **personal interests clash with professional or ethical duties**. 

### **Examples of Ethical Dilemmas in the Workplace:**
1. **Side Business:** Offering paid services to a client of your company.
2. **Bribes & Favors:** Accepting gifts in exchange for company secrets.
3. **Nepotism & Favoritism:** Ignoring a subordinate’s wrongdoing because they are a friend.
4. **Financial Manipulation:** Using company funds to benefit another business you own.
5. **Insider Trading:** Using confidential job information for personal gain.
6. **Competitor Conflicts:** Working for a competitor while employed at your company.
7. **Future Employment:** Arranging to work for a client while still doing business with them.

### **Can Conventional Morality Provide an Answer?**
- Should you **follow what your co-workers do**?
- Should you **copy your boss**?
- Should you base decisions on **what gets people fired**?
- Or is there a deeper ethical reasoning beyond convention?

## **2. Is Conventional Morality Enough?**
Many people **assume** that morality is simply about **following social norms** or **obeying authority**. But is this really enough?

✔ **Peter Singer** argues that **social norms don’t define morality**—ethics requires rational thought.  
✔ **Kohlberg’s moral development theory** suggests that **moral knowledge requires cognitive growth**, not just obedience to convention.  
✔ Ethical learning **is not just memorization**—it involves thinking critically about **right and wrong**.

> *Example:*  
> - In the past, **slavery** was legal and widely accepted.  
> - **Did that make it morally right?**  
> - If convention determined morality, **we could never justify moral progress**.

## **3. Moral Reasoning Revisions**
Before discussing moral development, let’s clarify key terms:

### **Self-Interest vs. Selfishness**
✔ **Self-interest**: Acting in a way that benefits yourself. (*Example: Eating to survive is self-interested but not wrong.*)  
✔ **Selfishness**: Excessive concern with self-interest, even at the expense of others. (*Example: Taking someone else's food when they are starving.*)  

> **Key Distinction:**  
> - A prime minister caring about their country is **not selfish**, even if self-interested.  
> - A person can **satisfy personal desires without being selfish**, as long as their actions benefit others too.

### **Psychological vs. Normative Egoism**
✔ **Psychological Egoism** (*Descriptive Theory*): *Everyone always acts in self-interest, even when they appear to help others.*  
✔ **Normative Egoism** (*Prescriptive Theory*): *People should only act in self-interest.*  

**Rebuttal to Psychological Egoism:**  
- Hume argues that **benevolence (genuine kindness) exists**—we are not always selfish.  
- Williams says **acting on our desires is fine**, but what matters is **whether those desires are always selfish or not**.

✔ **Virtuous people enjoy moral actions**—*helping others isn’t just self-interest, but a sign of moral development.*

## **4. Kohlberg’s Theory of Moral Development**
Inspired by **Piaget’s research on child psychology**, Kohlberg identified **six stages of moral development**, grouped into **three levels**.

### **I. Preconventional Morality (Self-Interest & Obedience)**
1. **Obedience & Punishment:** Morality is about avoiding punishment.  
   - *Example:* A child avoids stealing **only because they might get caught**.  
   - *Weakness:* Morality based purely on **fear of consequences**.  

2. **Instrumental Exchange (Self-Interest, "What's in it for me?")**  
   - Morality is about **personal gain**.  
   - *Example:* "Heinz can steal the drug if he wants his wife to live, but he doesn’t have to if he prefers a younger wife."  
   - *Weakness:* Morality is based only on **personal benefit**.  

### **II. Conventional Morality (Social Approval & Law)**
3. **"Good Boy/Nice Girl" Morality (Peer Approval)**  
   - People seek **praise and acceptance**.  
   - *Example:* A teenager donates to charity **to look good** rather than because it's the right thing to do.  
   - *Weakness:* **Social approval, not ethical principles, determines right and wrong**.  

4. **Law and Order (Authority & Rules)**  
   - Morality means **following laws and respecting authority**.  
   - *Example:* "Stealing is wrong because laws exist to keep order."  
   - *Weakness:* **Unquestioning obedience** can lead to supporting **unjust laws** (e.g., apartheid, slavery).  

> **Example:** Nazi officers who followed orders, despite committing atrocities.  
> **Lesson:** **Moral people should question authority when necessary.**  

### **III. Postconventional Morality (Universal Ethics & Justice)**
5. **Social Contract & Human Rights**  
   - Laws are **important but not absolute**—they should be changed if they harm people.  
   - *Example:* Civil rights activists breaking unjust segregation laws.  
   - *Strength:* Encourages **critical thinking and ethical reform**.  

6. **Universal Ethical Principles (Moral Truths Beyond Laws)**  
   - Morality is based on **justice, human rights, and universal ethical truths**.  
   - *Example:* Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mandela **broke laws to fight injustice**.  
   - *Strength:* People at this level **challenge corruption and create moral progress**.  

✔ **Very few people reach Level 6.**  
✔ **Moral maturity requires going beyond what is conventionally accepted.**

## **5. The Heinz Dilemma – Moral Conflict**
*Kohlberg tested moral development using the **Heinz dilemma**:*

> **Scenario:** A man named Heinz has a dying wife. A druggist has the only cure but charges 10x the production cost. Heinz cannot afford it. He asks for a discount, but the druggist refuses. Out of desperation, Heinz steals the drug.  
>  
> **Question:** *Was Heinz morally right to steal the drug?*

✔ **Preconventional Answer:** *"No, stealing is wrong because he might get caught."*  
✔ **Conventional Answer:** *"No, laws exist for a reason." OR "Yes, because good husbands protect their wives."*  
✔ **Postconventional Answer:** *"Yes, because saving a life is morally more important than property rights."*  

> **Lesson:** The answer **isn’t just about obeying laws**—it’s about questioning moral principles.

---

## **6. Peter Singer – Challenging Convention**
Singer argues that **conventional morality is often flawed** and **we should challenge traditions**. 

✔ **Example:** **Animal Rights**  
   - Historically, humans viewed **only other humans** as deserving of moral consideration.  
   - Singer: **Morality should be based on the ability to suffer, not species.**  
   - Animals feel pain → **They deserve moral consideration.**  

✔ **Example:** **Future AI Rights**  
   - If machines develop **consciousness**, should they have rights?  
   - Singer: *Possibly!* Ethics shouldn’t be limited to **human traditions**.  

✔ **Example:** **Unethical Norms in Tech**  
   - In the 1990s, **hacking and piracy were normalized**.  
   - Today, we see the **ethical problems** with hacking privacy, AI bias, and surveillance capitalism.  
   - **Moral progress requires questioning norms!**  

---

## **7. Conclusion: Are We All “Speciesists”?**
Singer argues that **most people are speciesists**—we **favor human interests** over animals **without justification**.  

**Key Discussion Questions:**
1. **Are we speciesists by default?**  
2. **Is it wrong to rank humans above animals?**  
3. **Can we blindly trust workplace ethics, or should we challenge unethical industry norms?**  
4. **Is loyalty to a company always ethical, or should personal morality take priority?**  

---

### **Final Takeaways:**
✔ **Conventional morality is not enough**—we must think critically.  
✔ **Moral development happens in stages**—not everyone reaches advanced moral reasoning.  
✔ **Peter Singer challenges traditional morality**—rights should be based on **capacity for suffering, not species or tradition**.  
✔ **Moral maturity requires questioning norms, not just obeying them.**  

> **Next Steps:**  
> - Think about **your own moral development**—where do you fall in Kohlberg’s stages?  
> - Identify **unethical norms in your industry**—what can be challenged?

# Case Study
### **Case Study Analyses: Conventional Morality and Conflicts of Interest**  
**(Lecture 2 – Kohlberg’s Moral Development, Loyalty, and Ethical Decision-Making)**  

---

## **1. Torn Between Competing Loyalties (Sarah’s Case: Loyalty to Friend vs. Employer)**  

### **1. Should Sarah prioritize her loyalty to her friend over her moral duty to her employer, especially when no explicit legal boundaries are being crossed?**  
- **No, Sarah should not prioritize her friend’s needs over her professional duty** because even though there is no explicit legal breach, ethical duties go beyond what is legally required.  
- **Stage 4 (Law and Order) of Kohlberg’s Model:** Ethical behavior is guided by following rules that **maintain social order** and trust within an organization. Even if Sarah’s employer hasn’t explicitly forbidden casual conversations, **sharing confidential insights would break professional trust**.  
- **Potential for Future Harm:** Even casual advice could **lead to unfair competitive advantages**, damaging her employer’s interests and reputation.  
- **Ethical Slippery Slope:** Small ethical breaches often lead to bigger ones. If Sarah justifies this now, she may justify worse actions later.  

### **2. How should Sarah weigh her personal relationships against the potential impact of sharing sensitive information?**  
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Personal relationships should not override **ethical and professional responsibilities**.  
- **Utilitarian Perspective:** If Sarah helps Lisa, **it might benefit Lisa's company** but harm **many employees at Sarah’s firm**. The **aggregate harm outweighs the benefit**.  
- **Stage 5 (Social Contract) of Kohlberg’s Model:** Ethical decision-making should consider **universal principles, such as fairness and trust**, rather than personal loyalty.  

### **3. Are there alternative ways Sarah could support her friend without compromising her moral obligations to her employer?**  
- **General Advice Only:** Sarah could offer **industry-wide best practices** without revealing confidential insights.  
- **Encourage Lisa to Innovate Independently:** Instead of feeding Lisa proprietary information, she could **suggest market research methods** or **connect Lisa with a mentor**.  
- **Maintain Clear Professional Boundaries:** She could be transparent with Lisa, saying, **“I value our friendship, but I need to maintain professional integrity.”**  

### **4. What are the broader implications of Sarah’s decision for professional trust and personal integrity?**  
- **Long-Term Trust in the Industry:** If Sarah is known for **protecting confidential data**, she will earn **professional respect and credibility**.  
- **Precedent for Ethical Behavior:** If she normalizes small ethical breaches, **it may become routine** for her or others to violate trust in the future.  
- **Legal and Reputational Risks:** If her company **discovers the leak**, she could **lose her job or damage her professional reputation**.

## **2. Torn Between Loyalty to the Company and Self-Interest (John’s Case: Side Project Conflict)**  

### **1. Is John justified in pursuing his side project, given its potential benefits to society and his personal career growth?**  
- **Ethically, John is in a gray area.** While his project has **social value**, he is also **violating company trust and potentially competing with them**.  
- **Kohlberg’s Stage 4 (Law and Order):** John signed a contract that forbids competing projects. Following **agreed-upon rules is an ethical duty**, regardless of personal gain.  
- **Kohlberg’s Stage 5 (Social Contract):** If John **believes the contract is unfair**, he should **challenge it openly**, not **violate it secretly**.  

### **2. Should John disclose his project to his employer, even though it might lead to conflict or force him to give it up?**  
- **Yes, disclosure is the ethical choice** because honesty **protects professional integrity**.  
- **Transparency Builds Trust:** If John hides this, and his employer finds out, they **may view him as deceptive** and **terminate his employment**.  
- **Alternative Negotiation:** He could propose a **partnership** with his employer, showing that **his tool serves a different niche**.  

### **3. How should John balance his passion for innovation with his contractual and ethical obligations to his employer?**  
- **Respect Agreements:** If the company **funded his skills and training**, he has **a duty to be loyal**.  
- **Find Ethical Alternatives:** He could **develop the project after leaving the company** or **seek permission** to work on it as an independent initiative.  
- **Avoid Using Company Resources:** Using employer software/licenses for personal gain **is unethical and could be seen as theft**.  

### **4. What are the potential consequences for John and his employer if the conflict of interest is discovered?**  
- **For John:**  
  - **Job loss or legal action** (if contract violations are severe).  
  - **Reputation damage**, making it harder to secure future employment.  
- **For Employer:**  
  - **Trust erosion** among employees.  
  - **Potential financial loss** if John’s project competes directly.

## **3. The Perils of Blind Loyalty (Emma’s Case: Inflating AI Metrics for Investors)**  

### **1. Should Emma prioritize her loyalty to Michael, considering all he has done for her, or uphold her ethical standards?**  
- **No, ethical integrity must take priority.**  
- **Kohlberg’s Stage 4 (Law and Order):** Lying about product performance **is fraud**, which is illegal and unethical.  
- **Kohlberg’s Stage 5 (Social Contract):** Even if Michael means well, **deception in business erodes trust** and could lead to serious consequences.  
- **Loyalty Shouldn’t Justify Wrongdoing:** Just because Michael helped her, Emma **doesn’t owe him unethical favors**.  

### **2. How should Emma handle the conflict between her personal gratitude and professional integrity?**  
- **Gratitude ≠ Blind Obedience:** While she appreciates Michael’s mentorship, **she must hold him accountable** for ethical breaches.  
- **Seek a Middle Path:** She could **offer alternative solutions**, like **framing the AI tool’s strengths honestly** rather than exaggerating.  
- **Find Support:** If Michael retaliates, she should **escalate concerns to HR or company leadership**.  

### **3. What are the potential consequences for Emma, Michael, and the company if she complies with his request?**  
- **For Emma:**  
  - She risks **being complicit in fraud**, leading to **firing, legal action, or reputational damage**.  
  - If the deception is exposed, **investors will lose trust**, and she may be blacklisted from the industry.  
- **For Michael:**  
  - If caught, **he could face termination or even legal consequences**.  
  - His reputation as a leader will be permanently damaged.  
- **For the Company:**  
  - **Legal risks** if investors sue for fraud.  
  - **Financial and reputational harm**, leading to **loss of funding and trust**.  

### **4. Are there ways Emma can address the situation without compromising her values or damaging her relationship with her boss?**  
- **Propose Ethical Alternatives:** She could suggest ways to **honestly highlight strengths** of the AI tool rather than inflating data.  
- **Encourage Transparency:** She could **remind Michael that short-term deception could cause long-term harm**.  
- **Report if Necessary:** If Michael refuses, she may need to **escalate the issue** to HR or leadership.

## **Final Takeaways Across All Cases:**  

- **Loyalty is important, but ethical integrity must come first.**  
- **Following rules and contracts is crucial**, but questioning them ethically (Stage 5 reasoning) is also valuable.  
- **Personal benefits don’t justify dishonesty.**  
- **Trust and professional integrity are hard to build but easy to lose.**  

In all these cases, the best ethical approach is **transparent communication, upholding integrity, and seeking ethical alternatives** to conflicts of interest.
