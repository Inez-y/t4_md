# **Lecture 3: Relativism and Objectivism – A Detailed Explanation**  

This lecture explores **moral relativism** and **moral objectivism**, their implications in ethics, and their relevance in real-world decision-making. It also clarifies common **misconceptions about moral judgment, tolerance, and hypocrisy** in ethical discussions.  

---

## **1. What is Moral Relativism?**  

Moral **relativism** is the belief that **morality is not absolute** but instead depends on:  
1. **Culture** (Cultural Relativism) – What is right or wrong depends on what a given society believes.  
2. **Social groups** – Different communities or professions have different ethical norms.  
3. **Personal beliefs** – Each individual may have their own set of moral rules.  

**Key Relativist Claims:**  
- **There is no universal moral truth.**  
- **Different moral views can all be correct within their own cultural context.**  
- **We cannot judge moral claims across cultures.**  

### **Example: Microsoft Disrupting Russian Cyberattacks**  
- A moral **relativist** might argue that both Russia and Ukraine have their own valid perspectives:  
  - *From Ukraine’s point of view:* Russia is the aggressor, so stopping cyberattacks is justified.  
  - *From Russia’s point of view:* Ukraine aligning with NATO is a threat, so cyberattacks are justified.  
- **Conclusion (Relativism):** Both sides are "right" in their own cultural context.

## **2. Relativism in Business and Technology**  

**Example: ATM "Dark Patterns"**  
- A **bank designs ATMs** so that users accidentally accept high fees by making the “Agree” button misleading.  
- **A Relativist Might Say:**  
  - *From the user’s perspective:* This is unethical, as the system tricks them into paying more.  
  - *From the bank’s perspective:* Users should read carefully, and maximizing profit is fair.  

**Relativist Conclusion:** No universal ethical answer—both views are "correct" in their own context.  

### **Criticism of Relativism**
- It allows **any practice to be justified**, no matter how unfair or exploitative.  
- It can be used to excuse **unethical corporate behavior** and **human rights abuses**.  

---

## **3. Is Moral Relativism a Strawman?**  

Relativism is **not just an extreme philosophical position**—it’s used in everyday discussions:  
1. **Data Privacy**: Different countries have different rules (e.g., GDPR in Europe vs. lax data laws elsewhere).  
2. **Content Moderation**: What’s “free speech” in one country is “harmful propaganda” in another.  
3. **Hacking for Justice**: Ethical hackers might be seen as **heroes in some places**, **criminals in others**.  
4. **Algorithmic Fairness**: Hiring practices differ—affirmative action is required in some places, illegal in others.  

**Relativist Perspective:**  
- "Who are we to judge? It’s all based on different perspectives!"  

**Criticism:**  
- **Some actions have real moral consequences**, even if cultures disagree.  
- **Just because a culture accepts something doesn’t mean it’s right.**  

---

## **4. Tolerance and the Misuse of Relativism**  

Some **radical political views** misapply relativism:  
- **Extreme Left:**  
  - "We must tolerate every culture and practice, no matter what."  
  - "All cultures are equally valuable in every sense."  
- **Extreme Right:**  
  - "Traditional values must be protected—anything that challenges them is evil."  
  - "Relativist excuse-making" (e.g., saying *"both sides have good people"*, even when one side is clearly unethical).  

**Relativism can be used to avoid difficult moral questions:**  
- *"Russia is just doing what the US has done before!"*  
- *"Afghanistan is thriving under the Taliban!"*  

**Problem:**  
- **Relativism can prevent meaningful moral criticism.**  
- **It is often used to "muddy the waters" and justify harmful practices.**  

---

## **5. The Danger of "Never Judging"**  

A common belief: **“It’s wrong to judge others”**  
- Based on **Judeo-Christian teachings**: *“Do not judge, or you too will be judged.”*  
- **Misinterpretation:**  
  - Some take this to mean *we should never make moral judgments.*  
- **Problem:**  
  - Avoiding judgment means **allowing injustice to continue unchecked.**  

### **Appeal to Hypocrisy (A Logical Fallacy)**  
- People argue: *"You can’t criticize X unless you are morally perfect yourself!"*  
- Example:  
  - Hannah says *"Murder is wrong."*  
  - Someone responds: *"But you’ve lied before, so you can’t judge!"*  
- **Why this is a fallacy:**  
  - Whether something is right or wrong **doesn’t depend on the person making the judgment.**  

---

## **6. Cultural Relativism vs. Universal Moral Truths (James Rachels)**  

**Empirical Fact:** Different cultures have different moral beliefs.  
- **Example:** Some cultures eat their dead, while others cremate them.  
- **Cultural Relativism Argument:**  
  - *"Since moral beliefs vary, there is no objective moral truth."*  
  - **James Rachels:** This argument is **logically flawed**—just because people disagree doesn’t mean there’s no correct answer!  

### **Problems with Cultural Relativism**  
1. **We couldn’t criticize harmful practices.**  
   - Slavery, stoning, racism, FGM—if a culture accepts them, does that make them “right”?  
2. **Moral progress would be impossible.**  
   - If morality is only based on society, then **ending apartheid in South Africa wasn’t progress—it was just change.**  
3. **Some values are universal.**  
   - Every society values **truth, caring for infants, and preventing unnecessary killing.**  

**Conclusion:**  
- **Not all moral disagreements are as deep as they seem.**  
- **Many cultural differences are about facts, not values** (e.g., Hindus don’t eat cows because they believe in reincarnation).  

---

## **7. Objectivism vs. Absolutism**  

- **Moral Objectivism:** There are **moral facts that are true regardless of culture or opinion**.  
  - *Example:* Murder is always wrong, even if a culture accepts it.  
- **Moral Absolutism:** Morality is based on **absolute, unchangeable rules**.  
  - *Example:* "Lying is always wrong" (even if it saves a life).  

**Key Difference:**  
- Objectivists believe in moral truths, but they **allow for context.**  
- Absolutists believe in **hard rules with no exceptions.**  

---

## **8. Can We Judge and Still Be Tolerant?**  

Yes! Being a moral objectivist **doesn’t mean being intolerant.**  
- **Example:**  
  - Tolerating different **clothing styles** is fine.  
  - Tolerating **child abuse or slavery** is not.  

**Final Thought:**  
- **Relativism can be useful for understanding cultural differences, but it cannot justify harmful practices.**  
- **Objectivism allows for moral criticism while still recognizing context and nuance.**

### **9. Summary of Key Concepts**  

| **Concept** | **Definition** | **Problem With It** |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Moral Relativism** | Morality depends on culture, society, or individual opinion. | Prevents moral progress, allows injustice. |
| **Cultural Relativism** | Different cultures have different moral beliefs, so morality is culture-based. | Makes criticism of harmful practices impossible. |
| **Moral Objectivism** | Some moral truths exist universally, regardless of opinion. | Doesn’t tell us which values are correct. |
| **Moral Absolutism** | Morality is based on unchanging, absolute rules. | Ignores context and complexity. |

# Case Study
### **Case Study Analysis: Rejecting Ethical Relativism in Cybercrime and Business Ethics**  
**(Lecture 3 – Ethical Relativism vs. Moral Objectivism in Cybersecurity and Business Ethics)**  

---

## **Case 1: Hacktivism (K’s Dilemma: Loyalty vs. Ethical Standards)**  

### **1. Should K support his friends' actions based on his cultural values, even if they conflict with the ethical standards of his workplace?**  

- **No, K should not support the hack.**  
- **Rejecting Ethical Relativism:** The fact that hacktivism is acceptable in K’s home country does **not** mean it is ethical everywhere. Right and wrong are not **culturally determined**—they depend on **objective ethical standards** like **justice, transparency, and harm reduction**.  
- **Kohlberg’s Moral Development (Stage 5 – Social Contract & Individual Rights):** K should recognize that laws **should be questioned when unjust**, but breaking the law is **only justified if it truly maximizes justice without disproportionate harm**.  
- **Utilitarianism’s Perspective:** Even if the hack exposes environmental violations, it could also **cause unintended harm**, such as job losses, data leaks affecting innocent people, or infrastructure damage.  
- **Alternatives:** K could help expose corporate wrongdoing **through legal channels**—like investigative journalism, whistleblower protections, or advocacy.  

---

### **2. How can you determine whether hacking is moral in this case?**  

- **Not all hacking is the same:** Ethical evaluation depends on **intention, consent, legality, and consequences**.  
- **White Hat Hacking (Ethical):** If K were hacking **with permission** to strengthen security, this would be ethical.  
- **Black Hat Hacking (Unethical):** If the hack is meant to **harm, steal, or create chaos**, it is morally wrong.  
- **Grey Hat Hacking (Context-Sensitive):** If the hack **exposes environmental crimes**, but also **violates privacy, breaks laws, or harms innocents**, it may still be **ethically unjustified**.  

---

### **3. What are the broader implications of accepting or normalizing such actions under the guise of cultural relativism?**  

- **Destabilization of Global Ethics:** If every culture justifies hacking **based on local norms**, cybersecurity would collapse, and trust in digital systems would erode.  
- **Justifying Harmful Practices:** If hacktivism is **justified on cultural grounds**, then corporations could **justify environmental harm** the same way, leading to an ethical double standard.  
- **Encouraging Lawlessness:** If hacking is normalized **as activism**, it could be used **not just for justice, but for revenge, corporate espionage, or political manipulation**.  

**Conclusion:** K should **reject cultural relativism** and act according to universal ethical principles.

## **Case 2: Using Ransomware as a Way to "Move Up in Life" (Maya’s Dilemma: Economic Hardship vs. Cybercrime Ethics)**  

### **1. Should Maya support her friends’ ransom scheme based on her cultural perspective, even though it conflicts with ethical standards?**  

- **No, Maya should not participate.**  
- **Rejecting Ethical Relativism:** Just because **ransomware is culturally normalized** in her home country does **not** make it morally right. Ethics **transcend local customs**.  
- **Utilitarian Perspective:** Holding data for ransom **harms many for the benefit of a few**—it causes economic loss, disrupts businesses, and can affect innocent people.  
- **Kohlberg’s Moral Development (Stage 5 & 6 – Social Contract & Universal Principles):** Ethics should be based on **universal fairness**, not cultural justification.  

---

### **2. How can she reconcile her cultural values with ethical expectations in her current environment? Should she change values every time she moves?**  

- **Distinguish between laws and morality:** Some cultural values (e.g., **hospitality, respect for elders**) are personal and can adapt. Others, like **basic ethical principles (honesty, justice, integrity)**, are universal and should not change.  
- **Principled Adaptation:** Maya should **recognize that ethical principles are not relative**—if something is wrong (stealing, harming others), it remains wrong regardless of location.  

---

### **3. Should we judge Maya, although she is from another culture?**  

- **Yes, but fairly.**  
- **Cultural upbringing may explain actions, but it does not excuse unethical behavior.**  
- **Moral Objectivism:** Some actions—like ransomware, bribery, and fraud—are **universally wrong** because they harm others.  
- **Judging vs. Understanding:** We should **understand** Maya’s background but also **hold her accountable** to ethical standards.  

---

## **Case 3: Culturally-Accepted Bribery (Daniel’s Dilemma: Corporate Integrity vs. Local Business Norms)**  

### **1. Is bribery wrong, or does it depend on whether the culture is OK with it?**  

- **Bribery is always ethically wrong**, even if a culture accepts it.  
- **Rejecting Relativism:** Corruption **damages trust, fairness, and economic stability**.  
- **Utilitarianism’s Perspective:** Bribery might **benefit a few individuals** but **hurts businesses, economies, and social fairness in the long run**.  

---

### **2. Should Daniel conform to local practices if they conflict with his company’s ethical standards?**  

- **No, he should not engage in bribery.**  
- **Kohlberg’s Stage 5 (Social Contract):** Laws should be followed **unless they are unjust**—bribery is unfair and distorts fair competition.  
- **Long-Term Consequences:** If Daniel bribes once, it sets a precedent that **his company can be manipulated**, leading to **future unethical demands**.  

---

### **3. Does moral relativism solve or complicate ethical decision-making in international business?**  

- **Complicates it.**  
- If every country follows its own moral rules, **corruption, exploitation, and human rights violations would be justified under “cultural differences.”**  
- **Universal business ethics (e.g., transparency, honesty, fairness) provide stability** and reduce corruption worldwide.  

---

### **4. What are the risks of Daniel adopting a "when in Rome" mentality?**  

- **Legal Consequences:** If the company is caught bribing, it could face **fines, legal action, and reputational damage**.  
- **Ethical Slippery Slope:** If Daniel justifies bribery once, he **may justify worse ethical breaches later**.  
- **Loss of Corporate Integrity:** If bribery is normalized, companies **lose credibility and become vulnerable to extortion**.  

---

### **5. How can Daniel respect cultural differences without compromising ethical principles?**  

- **Find Ethical Workarounds:** Offer **non-monetary incentives** like **quality service, long-term partnerships, or training programs**.  
- **Advocate for Transparency:** Explain that **his company follows international ethical standards** and **cannot engage in bribery**.  
- **Engage in Ethical Negotiation:** If local norms require "gifts," propose **legal alternatives like charity donations or formal sponsorships**.  

---

## **Final Takeaways Across All Cases**  

- **Cultural norms do not define morality.** Ethics are **not relative** when fundamental principles like **honesty, justice, and harm reduction** are at stake.  
- **Rejecting ethical relativism does not mean rejecting cultural sensitivity.** We can **respect traditions** while **maintaining ethical standards**.  
- **Short-term gains from unethical actions (hacking, ransomware, bribery) lead to long-term harm.**  
- **Integrity builds long-term trust, stability, and ethical leadership.**  

Each case shows that **moral objectivism**—not relativism—**provides the strongest ethical foundation for cybersecurity, business, and global ethics.**
