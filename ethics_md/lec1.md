# **Lecture 1: Introduction to Ethics & Moral Reasoning**

This lecture serves as an introduction to **philosophy**, **ethics**, and the **principles of moral reasoning**, setting the foundation for ethical discussions throughout the course.

---

## **1. What is Philosophy?**
Philosophy deals with problems that **cannot be settled purely by empirical research** (scientific testing, observation, etc.). Instead, it focuses on **conceptual and logical analysis**.

### **Examples of Philosophical Questions:**
- **Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge)**: *What is knowledge?*
- **Logic**: *What constitutes valid reasoning?*
- **Metaphysics**: *What is time? Is there causation?*
- **Ethics**: *What makes an action morally right or wrong?*

Many sciences (e.g., physics, biology, psychology) **originated from philosophy**. Philosophers still contribute to areas like **philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of AI**.

---

## **2. What is Ethics?**
Ethics is a **branch of philosophy** that examines **moral values and principles**.

### **Three Main Areas of Ethics:**
1. **Meta-ethics** – Explores the **meaning of moral terms** and whether morality is **objective or subjective**.  
   - *Example:* Does "wrong" mean something objectively true, or is it just an emotional reaction (e.g., disgust)?
  
2. **Normative Ethics** – Determines which moral norms one **should** follow.  
   - *Example:* Is it always wrong to lie? Does morality depend on consequences, intentions, or character?

3. **Applied Ethics** – Examines what one **ought to do in specific cases**.  
   - *Example:* Is there a duty to protect personal data? Should companies be allowed to use dark patterns?

---

## **3. Philosophy is NOT Just Personal Opinion**
Philosophy is **not about expressing personal opinions** (e.g., *"I believe that X is wrong"*). Instead, it requires **rational arguments** to justify moral claims.

### **Key Points:**
✔ Arguments should be supported by **logical reasoning and ethical theories**.  
✔ Philosophy is **less subjective than people think**—good arguments follow clear reasoning.  
✔ Avoid **intuition-based** arguments without justification (e.g., *"I feel like X is wrong"*).  

> **Example:**  
> - **Weak argument:** "Lying on your resume is wrong because it just feels dishonest."  
> - **Strong argument:** "Lying on your resume is wrong because it undermines trust in the hiring process, which is necessary for fair employment."

---

## **4. Common Sense vs. Ethical Theories**
Many people rely on **common sense** to make moral judgments. However, **common sense can be flawed**.

✔ Ethical theories **help structure moral reasoning** beyond intuition.  
✔ Intuition is still useful to **test theories**—but it is not enough to justify actions.  
✔ *Example:*  
   - Common sense might say: *"Hacking military hospitals to weaken Russia in war is wrong."*  
   - But utilitarianism might justify it if it leads to **fewer overall deaths**.  

### **Why Ethical Theories Matter:**
- They **give us tools** to evaluate **complex moral issues**.  
- Relying only on intuition produces **weak arguments**.  

---

## **5. Moral Reasoning & Argument Structure**
Moral reasoning involves **evaluating whether actions are morally right or wrong** based on **logical arguments**.

### **Three Key Principles of Moral Reasoning:**
1. **"No ought without can"** – You **can’t** have a moral duty to do something **impossible**.  
   - *Example:* You **can’t** be morally required to save a drowning child if you **can’t swim**.

2. **"No ought from is"** – You **can’t** derive moral conclusions **just from facts**.  
   - *Example:* "Lies hurt people" is a fact, but **we must add a value statement** (e.g., *"hurting people without justification is wrong"*) to conclude that **lying is wrong**.

3. **Explanation ≠ Justification** – Just because we **explain** why something happens doesn’t mean it’s **morally justified**.  
   - *Example:* "I stole because I was poor" explains **why**, but it doesn’t justify theft.

---

## **6. Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Value**
- **Intrinsic Value:** Something valuable **for its own sake** (e.g., **happiness, justice**).  
- **Instrumental Value:** Something valuable **because it leads to something else** (e.g., **money, education**).  
- Some things can have **both** (e.g., **knowledge** is good in itself and helps in life).  

### **Moral Question:**  
- If human life has **intrinsic value**, is it always wrong to end it?  
- Or is life valuable only **instrumentally** (e.g., valuable because it allows happiness)?

---

## **7. Validity & Soundness in Moral Arguments**
Moral arguments must be **logically valid** and **sound**.

✔ **Valid Argument:** The **conclusion follows logically** from the premises.  
✔ **Sound Argument:** The argument is **valid AND the premises are true**.

> **Example:**  
> **Valid but not sound:**  
> - P1: All computers are intelligent.  
> - P2: Intelligence makes you miserable.  
> - C: Therefore, all computers are miserable.  
> - (Invalid because P1 is false.)

> **Sound Argument:**  
> - P1: Lying erodes trust.  
> - P2: Trust is necessary for ethical business.  
> - C: Therefore, lying in business is unethical.  
> - (Valid AND true premises → sound.)

---

## **8. Types of Claims in Ethics**
1. **Empirical Claims** – Based on observable facts.  
   - *Example:* "Methane emissions have increased."

2. **Value Claims** – Make moral judgments.  
   - *Example:* "Methane emissions should be reduced."

3. **Conceptual Claims** – Based on definitions.  
   - *Example:* "Mammals are animals."

---

## **9. Ethical Argument Example**
### **Value Argument Structure:**
1. **Major Premise (Value Claim):** *All humans should exercise.*  
2. **Minor Premise (Empirical Claim):** *I am human.*  
3. **Conclusion (Moral Judgment):** *I should exercise.*  

✔ **A moral argument requires BOTH empirical and value premises.**  
✔ *Example:* A valid argument against resume fraud must include **a value premise** (e.g., “Deception is wrong”).  

---

## **10. Is There Genuine Moral Action? (Plato’s Gyges' Ring)**
Plato’s **"Ring of Gyges"** thought experiment asks:  
- If you had a **magic ring that made you invisible**, would you still be moral?  
- Are people only moral because of **fear of punishment**?

---

## **11. Are We Always Selfish? Psychological Egoism vs. Genuine Morality**
### **Psychological Egoism** (Hobbes)  
✔ Claims that **all actions are ultimately selfish**.  
✔ Even when helping others, we do it **for personal gain (e.g., reputation, satisfaction).**  

### **Counterarguments (Hume & Williams):**  
❌ **Not all desires are selfish.**  
✔ People sometimes act **genuinely** for others (*e.g., a mother sacrificing for her child*).  
✔ Self-interest **is not the same as selfishness**—*drinking water is self-interested but not selfish*.  

### **Conclusion:**
- People can be motivated by **genuine morality**, not just **self-interest**.  
- **Selfishness ≠ self-interest**—taking care of yourself is fine, but **excessive self-interest** is problematic.  

---

## **12. Summary: What We Learned**
✔ **Ethics is not about opinion**—it requires **rational argumentation**.  
✔ **Moral reasoning** involves **valid arguments, intrinsic/instrumental values, and rejecting fallacies**.  
✔ **Psychological egoism is false**—genuine moral actions exist.  
✔ **We should use ethical theories, not just intuition, to analyze moral problems.**  

---

### **Key Discussion Questions:**
1. If you could **lie on your resume without getting caught**, would it still be wrong?  
2. Should we always act in **self-interest**, or do **genuine moral actions** exist?  
3. If people **only act morally because of fear of punishment**, is morality still meaningful?

# Case Study 
### **Case Study Analysis: Embellishing a CV for a Dream Job**  
**(Lecture 1 – Introduction to Ethics: Moral Reasoning and Ethical Decision-Making)**  

---

### **1. Is it ever justifiable to exaggerate qualifications if you believe you can perform the job well?**  
No, it is not justifiable to exaggerate qualifications, even if Alex believes he can perform the job well.  

**Ethical Reasoning:**  
- **No ought from is:** The fact that Alex *can* do the job does not imply that he *ought* to lie. Ethical justification cannot be based solely on outcomes (e.g., successfully doing the job).  
- **Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Value:** Honesty has intrinsic value, while career success has instrumental value. Lying for instrumental gain corrupts moral integrity.  
- **Kantian Ethics (though not covered in depth yet):** Lying treats the employer as a means to an end, which is unethical. If everyone lied on their CVs, trust in hiring processes would collapse.  
- **Utilitarian Consideration:** While Alex might benefit personally, his dishonesty could have wider negative consequences if discovered—damaging the company’s trust, setting a precedent for dishonesty, and harming future applicants who play fair.  

Thus, while it’s understandable why Alex is tempted to lie, **the ethical cost of dishonesty outweighs the potential benefit.**  

---

### **2. What are the potential consequences for Alex if his dishonesty is discovered after he is hired?**  
- **Professional Consequences:**  
  - Immediate termination and loss of job.  
  - Damage to reputation—word spreads quickly in tech, making it harder to get hired elsewhere.  
  - Potential **legal consequences** (e.g., fraudulent misrepresentation in employment contracts).  

- **Ethical Consequences:**  
  - Loss of integrity—he may rationalize future dishonesty, leading to more ethical breaches.  
  - Erosion of self-trust: Constant fear of exposure can create stress and anxiety.  

- **Impact on Others:**  
  - If fired, the company may hesitate to trust other candidates with non-traditional experience.  
  - If he struggles with job responsibilities, the team suffers, possibly affecting company success.  

Lying carries **high risks** that could undermine both his career and personal ethics.  

---

### **3. How should Alex weigh his personal needs against the ethical implications of lying on his CV?**  
- **Balancing Self-Interest and Ethics:**  
  - Personal needs (financial stability, career growth) **are important**, but they do not override ethical responsibilities.  
  - **Self-interest vs. selfishness:** It is not wrong for Alex to seek opportunities, but lying for personal gain at the expense of honesty is **selfish**, not just self-interested.  

- **Moral Decision-Making:**  
  - **Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Development** suggest that mature ethical reasoning (stages 5-6) **goes beyond self-benefit and considers universal principles.**  
  - Alex should strive for a **stage 5 approach** (social contract)—his duty is to act honestly, even if the system is competitive.  

**Conclusion:** Personal needs should **inform** ethical decisions but **not justify unethical behavior.** Integrity is a long-term asset that outweighs short-term career gains from dishonesty.  

---

### **4. Are there alternative ways Alex could demonstrate his skills and potential without resorting to dishonesty?**  
Yes! Instead of lying, Alex can:  

1. **Showcase Real Experience Creatively**  
   - Highlight **skills, projects, and freelance work** in machine learning.  
   - Create a **portfolio with code samples, GitHub repositories, or AI projects**.  
   - Provide strong **letters of recommendation** emphasizing his potential.  

2. **Be Honest but Strategic in His Application**  
   - Apply for **junior ML roles** or internships at the company.  
   - In an interview, emphasize **transferable skills** and willingness to learn.  

3. **Upskill Before Applying**  
   - Gain certifications in ML (Coursera, Udacity, TensorFlow Developer, etc.).  
   - Contribute to open-source AI projects to build credibility.  

4. **Network & Find Internal Advocates**  
   - Attend AI/tech meetups and connect with hiring managers for **referrals**.  
   - Many companies hire promising talent even if they don’t check every box.  

---

### **Final Verdict: What Should Alex Do?**  
Alex **should not** lie. Instead, he should:  
✅ Highlight relevant skills and experience.  
✅ Apply for alternative roles if needed.  
✅ Seek opportunities to **gain experience honestly** before aiming for the dream job.  

This approach maintains **ethical integrity** while still giving him a chance at career success!


### **Case Study Analysis: Using ChatGPT Instead of Learning Ethics**  
**(Lecture 1 – Introduction to Ethics: Moral Reasoning and Academic Integrity)**  

---

### **1. How does Jordan’s choice to use ChatGPT without disclosure affect his educational experience? What are the potential learning opportunities he might miss out on by not engaging more deeply with the course material?**  

- **Missed Conceptual Understanding:** Jordan bypasses **active engagement** with ethical reasoning, weakening his ability to **think critically** about moral issues. Ethics is not just about memorizing answers but about developing **moral reasoning skills**, which he won’t acquire through passive reliance on AI.  

- **Lack of Instructor Feedback:** If Jordan had written his own work, his professor could have provided **personalized feedback** to refine his reasoning. Without this, he may struggle later in class discussions or on exams.  

- **Weakened Retention for the Final Exam:** Since Jordan plans to “deal with it later,” he’s setting himself up for **cramming and poor long-term retention**, making the final exam more stressful than if he had learned properly from the start.  

- **Reduced Problem-Solving Skills:** Engaging deeply in ethical dilemmas helps students **develop decision-making skills** applicable to real-world ethical challenges. Jordan is **skipping a crucial part of his education**.  

---

### **2. What are the ethical implications of not disclosing the use of AI tools in academic assignments, even if it is allowed by the instructor?**  

- **Academic Dishonesty (Deception):**  
  - Even though using ChatGPT is allowed, Jordan **misleads his professor** into thinking the work is entirely his. This violates **transparency** and **academic honesty**.  
  - His professor may assume Jordan **engaged with the course material**, when in reality, he has not.  

- **Unfair Advantage:**  
  - Jordan is not held to the same standard as classmates who **write their own work and integrate AI properly**.  
  - If the professor grades Jordan’s work highly under the assumption that he genuinely produced it, **he benefits unfairly** compared to classmates who put in actual effort.  

- **Slippery Slope to Further Dishonesty:**  
  - If Jordan justifies this small ethical compromise, he might justify bigger ones later (e.g., **cheating on exams, falsifying credentials**).  
  - Ethics is about **habitual integrity**, and this decision weakens that foundation.  

---

### **3. How might Jordan’s decision be perceived by classmates who use ChatGPT properly, including acknowledging its use in their work? What implications does this have for academic integrity and fairness?**  

- **Resentment and Distrust:**  
  - Classmates who put in genuine effort might **see Jordan as dishonest**.  
  - Those who cite ChatGPT properly may feel **penalized for following the rules**, while Jordan **takes shortcuts without consequence**.  

- **Erosion of Academic Standards:**  
  - If many students act like Jordan, **the value of honest academic work declines**.  
  - Professors may become **more skeptical of all student work**, leading to **stricter policies** or **penalties for AI usage**.  

- **Encouraging a Culture of Minimal Effort:**  
  - If students see Jordan succeeding **without real engagement**, they might also start **prioritizing shortcuts** over learning.  
  - Over time, **academic integrity weakens**, and **degrees lose credibility**.  

---

### **4. What if Jordan says he’s “clever” by getting ahead of other classmates with less effort? Is he right?**  

No, Jordan **is not truly being clever**—he is **prioritizing short-term gains at the expense of long-term growth**.  

- **Cleverness vs. Ethical Integrity:**  
  - Being "clever" would mean finding **efficient ways to learn and improve**, not **cheating the system**.  
  - True cleverness involves **strategic effort**—e.g., using ChatGPT **as a tool to enhance learning** rather than as a replacement for thinking.  

- **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Success:**  
  - Jordan may “win” in the short term, but he **loses** in the long term:  
    ✅ He **saves time now**, but…  
    ❌ He **struggles later** when he lacks the knowledge for future assignments, discussions, and exams.  
    ❌ He **misses the point of education**—not just passing, but learning how to think critically.  

- **Ethical Leadership Matters:**  
  - Many tech professionals **succeed based on ethical responsibility** (e.g., handling AI bias, data privacy, security concerns).  
  - If Jordan normalizes **cutting corners**, he may one day **justify ethical breaches in his career**.  

---

### **Final Verdict: What Should Jordan Do?**  
✅ Use ChatGPT **as a study tool**, not a substitute for thinking.  
✅ Cite AI use transparently.  
✅ Prioritize **learning over short-term convenience**.  
✅ Manage time better instead of compromising academic integrity.  

This approach **upholds honesty**, **preserves learning**, and **sets a strong ethical foundation for his future career**.
